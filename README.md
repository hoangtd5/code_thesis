# Multivariate Time series forecasting with Keras

This project provides implementations of some deep learning algorithms for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting  
- Transformers  
- Recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU)  
- Convolutional neural networks  
- Multi-head multi-layer perceptron  


## Prequisites

Prequisites are defined in requirements.txt file  

## Running Example

A running example is implemented in \__main__.py  
Used Dataset is not included in this project  
A Jupyter notebook for RNN model is also available.  

## Dataset

The used open dataset 'Household Power Consumption' available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption  
Prep-processing steps to get the used cleaned version are available in the tutorial https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-step-time-series-forecasting-with-machine-learning-models-for-household-electricity-consumption/
